# Project Leme

My own little Scheme, built from the brilliant instructions at WYSAS.
This is a my second attempt at the project, as the [first time](https://github.com/limdauto/learning-haskell/tree/master/leme) was too
much monkey-coding to be educational.


## TODO

- An full intepreter with a REPL
- A webserver that provides the intepreter as a service
- An IDE, probably built on top of Atom
